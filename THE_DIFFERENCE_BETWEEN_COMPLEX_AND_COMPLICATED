THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPLEX AND COMPLICATED

To start with, a good image to separate complex from complicated is “a car is complicated while traffic is complex”.

Something that is complex, or has a high degree of complexity, is affected by many factors and circumstances. The factors might even be unknown or be far removed in time or distance. At the same time, the individual tasks in the complex work are all intertwined so it’s hard to see where one stops and the other begins.
A work or task with low degree of complexity means that it is possible to describe how it’s supposed to be done. The more knowledge and experience you gather, the better your decision-making will be. 

A complicated task is defined by how many variables and inputs it has, how much information needs to be taken into consideration, how hard it is to learn and how hard it is to calculate or predict the result. But even so, the result is predictable.
So when we say that the car is complicated, it’s because while few understand all of the systems and components in it you can predict how it will function.

In contrast, the traffic in a big city is affected by so many factors, many of which are unsure, that it’s not possible to predict exactly what the traffic situation of tomorrow morning is going to look like.

Somebody who gets energy from deep diving into something complicated will not like when things becomes too complex. They experience the complex as unclear, uncertain and confusing, and prefer difficult tasks where it is easy to see when you’re right and wrong.

Somebody who is drawn to the complex will on the other hand struggle with the complicated tasks that takes a long time to learn and has a lot of details that need to be correct.
